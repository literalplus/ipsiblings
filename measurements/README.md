# Measurement Statistics

These are the aggregated measurement results used for evaluation in this work. Raw data used to compute these (e.g. raw
clock skew estimations) are not provided here due to size (11 GB compressed) and we believe these statistics to be
sufficient for most tasks that could be based on the collected information.

The raw measurement results are archived at
[SBA Research](https://www.sba-research.org/) but no guarantees are made regarding retention. Please get in touch with
the author if access is desired for scientific research. Contact details are available on my GitHub profile and website.

## Privacy Considerations

All information reflected in these data is publicly available and obtained via the methodology described in the thesis.
While IP addresses are presented and related, we do not currently have reason to believe that the presented data
significantly invades privacy, since no correlation about owners is made and AS data is publicly available either way.
Members of the public Bitcoin network are also publicly available.

Additionally, these associations present a snapshot view of the Bitcoin network at each respective measurement time. As
such, they are not expected to generalise to later states of the network, reducing possible attack surface.

As discussed in the thesis, the proposed attack is not classified as feasible in practice, so an adversary using these
statistics to attack the Bitcoin Peer-to-Peer network should not gain significant advantage from this information being
publicly available, while the scientific community does profit from at least the statistical conclusions drawn in this
work being publicly verifiable.

**If for whatever reason there are privacy or security concerns from these measurement results being publicly available
that were not considered, please contact me via the email on my GitHub profile or the contact details provided on my
website. In such case, redaction might be performed.** Currently, as explained, I have no reason to believe that this
data poses any threat to the owners of described infrastructure.
